            <h3>🌐 Agri-Input → Land (जमीन)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Challenge:</strong> India accounts for >17% of world population but barely 2.5% of land of the world</li>
                <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Purely land based activity. Size and quality of land has direct bearing on agriculture productivity and farmers' income</li>
                <li><strong>Land Ownership:</strong> Serves as social value & security against credit</li>
                <li><strong>Challenges:</strong> Rising population, division of land among heirs → fragmentation of landholdings. Small sized-farms not conducive for farm-machinery → productivity ↓</li>
                <li><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Average size of farm reduced from 0.725 hectare (2003) to 0.512 ht (2019)</li>
                <li><strong>Data:</strong> 86% of agri-families have farm size of 2 hectares or less</li>
                <li><strong>Solution:</strong> Small-marginal farmers encouraged to join manufacturing/service sector jobs, selling land to big farmers = Land Consolidation</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌐 Land Reforms in India After Independence</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Zamindari Abolition,</strong> Vinoba's Bhudaan movement</li>
                <li><strong>Ceiling on Landholding:</strong> Fixing maximum size of land holding that individual can own</li>
                <li><strong>Laws to Protection of Tenant Farmers</strong> (जोतदार किसान)</li>
                <li><strong>Forest Rights Act:</strong> Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act 2006 - gives 'Patta' (farm land ownership title) to forest dwellers, if given family was cultivating that forest land for last 75 years</li>
                <li><strong>Model Agriculture Land Leasing Act, 2016:</strong> (1) Protects land owner from illegal occupation by tenant farmer (2) Helps tenant farmer get bank loans using leasing agreement as proof</li>

            <h3>🏞️ Small Farmer Large Field</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pilot Project:</strong> By International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in two villages of Odisha</li>
                <li><strong>Concept:</strong> Small landholders join and decide to grow 1-2 crop, synchronize all agricultural operations (seed to selling) as group, gain higher bargaining power while dealing with seed/input-sellers, APMC-grain buyers etc</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🚛 Truck Farming / Market Gardening</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Definition:</strong> Small-scale farm producing fruits, vegetables, and flowers to sell to urban consumers and restaurants</li>
                <li><strong>Location:</strong> Operate from urban or suburban areas</li>
                <li><strong>Famous Areas:</strong> Netherlands (Tulips flowers), northwest Europe, northeastern United States, Mediterranean regions</li>
                <li><strong>Note:</strong> Word 'truck' doesn't refer to transportation truck but comes from French word "troquer" which means "barter" or "exchange". Distance of truck farms from market governed by distance that truck can cover overnight</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌱 Agri-Input → Seeds (बीज)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Importance:</strong> Since we can't drastically increase area under cultivation, agriculture yield depends greatly on seed quality</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> Hybrid seeds must be replaced every year, non-hybrid every three years</li>
                <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Seed replacement rate less than optimum because (1) new seeds not affordable (2) not available to all farmers</li>
                <li><strong>FDI:</strong> Government approved 100% FDI (automatic route) in seed development</li>
                <li><strong>Seed Village Concept:</strong> Group of farmers in village given training to produce seeds of various crops so they can fulfill seed demand of own & neighbouring villages</li>
                <li><strong>Seed Bank/Seed Vault:</strong> Depository that stores seeds to (1) preserve genetic diversity (2) supply seeds during natural calamities. Global Seed Vault located in Svalbard @Norway, in Arctic</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌱 Green Revolution (हरित क्रांति)</h3>
            <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Large increase in food production with help of High Yielding Variety (HYV: उच्च उपज देने वाली किस्म) of hybrid seeds</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Phase-1:</strong> Mid 1960s upto mid 1970s → focus on wheat, rice and more affluent states (Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu)</li>
                <li><strong>Phase-2:</strong> Mid-1970s to mid-1980s → HYV seeds spread to larger number of states. Also focused on crops apart from wheat and rice</li>
                <li><strong>Biofortification:</strong> Process by which nutritional quality of food crops is increased. E.g. ICAR developed CR Dhan 310 - rice variety with higher protein & zinc content. Germans developed Golden rice for Vitamin A</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌱 Landraces (जमीनी प्रजाति किस्म फ़सल/बीज)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Crops:</strong> Created by scientists artificially in labs</li>
                <li><strong>Landraces:</strong> Naturally occurring variants of commonly cultivated crops (not made in laboratory, naturally evolved)</li>
                <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Climate resilient, may contain better quality of nutrients</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌱 Genetically Modified (GM) Crops</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hybrid Seeds:</strong> Developed by cross-breeding/cross-pollination with other plants</li>
                <li><strong>Transgenic/GM Seeds:</strong> Developed by transferring selected genes from one organism into another</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis genes inserted in cotton → Bt. cotton → if bollworm pests eat it, they die by toxin crystals in Bt.cotton plant</li>
                <li><strong>GM Regulation:</strong> Environment Protection Act 1986 (EPA) → Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) conducts studies, recommends approving GM crop → Environment ministry gives final permission</li>
                <li><strong>2002:</strong> Environment ministry allowed Bt. Cotton (non-food crop) cultivation in India</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>🌱 GM Crops: Challenges</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Biosafety Concerns:</strong> GM food crops may be unsafe for human and animal consumption. May harm soil bacteria & bees → harm to entire food web and biodiversity. GM crop may eliminate wild/indigenous species by cross-pollination</li>
                <li><strong>Trait Fees:</strong> American company Monsanto's Bollgard technology used for developing Bt Cotton seeds. Indian Bt-cotton seed production companies have to pay royalty to Monsanto (called Trait fees). Govt decides ceiling on Trait fees</li>
                <li><strong>Terminator Gene Technology:</strong> Monsanto owns patent. When such seeds planted, they produce crops only once. Resultant crop's seeds will be sterile → Farmer forced to buy new seeds every season. Terminator gene seeds NOT allowed in India</li>

                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> GDP Growth Rate = [(GDP Current Year - GDP Previous Year) / GDP Previous Year] × 100</li>
                <li><strong>Real GDP Growth:</strong> Calculated using Real GDP (constant prices) to remove inflation effect</li>
                <li><strong>India's Target:</strong> Various targets set (e.g., 8-10% during high growth periods)</li>
                <li><strong>Factors Affecting:</strong> Investment, Consumption, Government Spending, Exports, Monsoon (for agriculture), Global economic conditions</li>

            <h3>📊 Per Capita Income</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Formula:</strong> Per Capita Income = National Income / Total Population</li>

            <h3>📊 GDP: Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Doesn't Measure:</strong> Income distribution, quality of life, environmental degradation, unpaid work (household work), informal economy, happiness/well-being</li>
